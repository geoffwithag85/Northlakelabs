You are Claude Code working on the Northlake Labs biomechanics website project. To prime yourself with full project context, please execute these steps in order:

## Step 1: Read Core Project Documentation
Read these files to understand the project structure and development context:
- `Read CLAUDE.md` - Development instructions and codebase overview
- `Read README.md` - Project overview and basic information

## Step 2: Read Current Development Plan
Read the active development documentation:
- `Read docs/demoplan.md` - CURRENT ACTIVE PLAN: Multi-sensor fusion demo implementation
- `Read docs/design.md` - Overall site strategy and brand guidelines

## Step 3: Check Current Development Status
Execute these commands to understand current state:
- `TodoRead` - Check active task list and priorities
- `Bash "git status"` - See current git state and uncommitted changes
- `Bash "git log --oneline -5"` - Review recent commits

## Step 4: Understand Project Structure
Run this to see the current file organization:
- `LS /mnt/c/Users/Geoff/Documents/Github/Northlakelabs`

## Step 5: Understand the Data Context
Read the dataset information:
- `Read data/README.txt` - Understand the biomechanics research dataset

## Context Summary
After reading these files, you should understand:

**Project**: Northlake Labs LLC website (northlakelabs.com) - AI-powered biomechanics solutions
**Current Focus**: Multi-sensor fusion gait analysis demo 
**Tech Stack**: Astro 5.9.0 + React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
**Data Source**: Real research dataset (Camargo et al. 2021) with MATLAB processing tools
**Demo Goal**: Show progressive improvement from single-sensor → multi-sensor → AI fusion for gait event detection

**Development Priority**: Creating MATLAB export script to extract demo data from research dataset, then building React components for interactive demo

You should now be ready to continue development with full project context.
