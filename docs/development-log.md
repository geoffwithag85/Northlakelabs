## Recent Sessions

### June 18, 2025 - Interactive Controls & Event Visualization Fix
**Duration**: 3.5 hours  
**Achievements**:
- âœ… Interactive threshold controls with real-time sliders completed
- âœ… Live statistics display with asymmetry analysis implemented
- âœ… Chart.js event markers bug fixed (full dataset + axis limits approach)
