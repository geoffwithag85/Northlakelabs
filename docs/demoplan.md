# Multi-Sensor Fusion for Gait Event Detection Demo

## Demo Overview
Interactive demonstration showing how multi-sensor fusion with AI dramatically improves gait event detection accuracy compared to traditional single-sensor approaches.

## Core Concept
**Progressive Enhancement: From Single Sensor to Intelligent Multi-Sensor Fusion**

**The Story**: "Why pathological gait analysis needs AI-powered multi-sensor fusion"

**Unique Demo Value**: Constrained gait (left leg locked) creates challenging detection scenarios where traditional algorithms fail, but AI adapts and learns.

Users experience the evolution:
1. **Traditional**: Force plate only (60% accuracy) - fails with asymmetric patterns
2. **Basic Fusion**: Force plate + EMG (75% accuracy) - rigid rules can't adapt 
3. **AI Fusion**: Multi-modal intelligent integration (92% accuracy) - learns constraint patterns

## Target Audience Value
- **Hardware Engineers**: See why sensor diversity matters for pathological conditions
- **Software Engineers**: Understand AI fusion advantages over rule-based systems
- **Researchers**: Learn multi-modal data integration for constrained movement
- **Clinicians**: Observe practical accuracy improvements with pathological gait
- **Rehabilitation Specialists**: See AI adaptation to orthotic/surgical constraints
- **Decision Makers**: Clear ROI of intelligent vs simple approaches for clinical populations

## Clinical Significance & Demo Advantages

### Why Constrained Gait Makes a Better Demo
1. **Real-World Relevance**: Represents actual clinical populations (stroke, orthopedic, neurological)
2. **Algorithm Challenge**: Traditional methods fail dramatically with asymmetric patterns
3. **AI Superiority**: Machine learning truly shines when adapting to non-normal patterns
4. **Educational Impact**: Shows why healthcare needs intelligent, not just automated, systems

### Constraint Condition Benefits
- **Clear Visual Differences**: Left leg locked creates obvious asymmetry in all sensor data
- **Compensatory Patterns**: Right leg shows clear adaptations, EMG shows bilateral changes
- **Algorithm Failure Points**: Traditional thresholds completely break down
- **AI Learning Opportunity**: Perfect scenario for demonstrating pattern recognition

### Professional Credibility
- **Real Research Data**: Actual biomechanics lab collection with clinical constraints
- **Multi-Modal Validation**: Force plates + EMG + motion capture integration
- **Pathological Relevance**: Directly applicable to rehabilitation and assistive technology

## Data Processing Pipeline Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Trial Analysis & Selection (Day 1)

#### 1.1 Automated Trial Quality Assessment
- **Script**: `scripts/analyze-trials.js`
- **Process**: Loop through T1-T30, analyze each for:
  - Data completeness (no missing values in force/EMG)
  - Constraint visibility (left vs right force asymmetry ratio)
  - Gait consistency (regular heel-strike patterns)
  - Clean walking segments (identify steady-state periods)
- **Output**: Ranked list of top 5 trials with quality metrics
- **Key Insight**: Trials are ~300 seconds, need to extract optimal 20-second segments

#### 1.2 Manual Trial Selection
- **Process**: Visual inspection of top 5 candidates
- **Criteria**: 
  - Clear left leg constraint pattern
  - Obvious compensatory right leg loading
  - Stable walking rhythm (good for ground truth events)
  - Minimal noise/artifacts in EMG data
- **Deliverable**: Single selected trial (e.g., "T05") for demo development

### Phase 2: Data Processing Pipeline Architecture (Day 1-2)

#### 2.1 Processing Strategy
```
Raw CSV Files (300s trials) 
    ↓
Segment Extraction (find best 20s window)
    ↓  
Data Synchronization (align 1000Hz/2000Hz/100Hz)
    ↓
Preprocessing (filtering, normalization)
    ↓
Ground Truth Generation (detect gait events)
    ↓
JSON Export (optimized for demo loading)
```

#### 2.2 Build-Time vs Runtime Processing
**Decision**: Build-time processing for demo data
- **Rationale**: Pre-process heavy CSV parsing, only load optimized JSON at runtime
- **Implementation**: Node.js script generates static demo data during `npm run build`
- **Benefits**: Instant demo loading, no CSV parsing overhead in browser

#### 2.3 File Structure

└── T05-metadata.json          # Clinical context
```

### Phase 3: Segment Extraction Algorithm (Day 2)

#### 3.1 Optimal Window Selection
**Goal**: Find best 20-second window within 300-second trial
**Algorithm**:
1. **Sliding window analysis**: 20s windows with 5s step
2. **Quality scoring**: Rate each window for:
   - Gait consistency (regular heel-strikes)
   - Constraint visibility (force asymmetry)
   - Data quality (minimal artifacts)
   - EMG signal clarity
3. **Selection**: Highest scoring window becomes demo data

#### 3.2 Gait Event Ground Truth
**Method**: Force plate threshold detection with manual validation
- **Automated detection**: Threshold-based heel-strike/toe-off
- **Visual validation**: Plot events over force data for verification
- **Confidence scoring**: Based on force magnitude and timing consistency

### Phase 4: Data Synchronization Strategy (Day 2)

#### 4.1 Master Timeline Approach
- **Master**: Kinetics 1000Hz (highest resolution for force events)
- **EMG**: Downsample 2000Hz → 1000Hz (every 2nd sample)
- **Kinematics**: Upsample 100Hz → 1000Hz (linear interpolation)
- **Result**: Unified 1000Hz timeline for all modalities

#### 4.2 Preprocessing Pipeline
```javascript
// Force plate preprocessing
- Baseline correction (subtract resting values)
- Low-pass filter 50Hz (remove noise)
- Body weight normalization

// EMG preprocessing  
- High-pass filter 20Hz (remove motion artifacts)
- Rectification and envelope detection
- Normalize to percentage of max activation

// Kinematics preprocessing
- Gap filling (spline interpolation)
- Low-pass filter 10Hz (smooth trajectories)
- Calculate joint angles from marker positions
```

### Phase 5: Performance Optimization (Day 3)

#### 5.1 Data Compression Strategy
- **JSON optimization**: Remove redundant precision (2 decimal places)
- **Array compression**: Use typed arrays where possible
- **Gzip compression**: Automatic via GitHub Pages/CDN
- **Target size**: <500KB for 20s demo trial

#### 5.2 Runtime Loading Strategy
```typescript
// Lazy loading approach
const demoData = await import(`/demo-data/${trialId}.json`);

// Progressive loading for large datasets
const metadata = await loadMetadata(trialId);
const sensorData = await loadSensorData(trialId);
const events = await loadGroundTruth(trialId);
```
