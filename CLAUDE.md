# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Northlake Labs LLC company website - an Astro-based static site showcasing AI-powered biomechanics solutions. The site combines hardware and software offerings with interactive demonstrations and professional content.

**Live Site**: https://www.northlakelabs.com
**Framework**: Astro 5.9.0 with React integration
**Deployment**: GitHub Pages with automated workflows

## Development Commands

### Fast Development (Recommended)
```bash
# Fast development - instant startup using cached data
npm run dev-fast

# Fast build - instant build using cached data  
npm run build-fast
```

### Full Development (When Data Changes)
```bash
# Full development - processes data + starts server
npm run dev

# Full build - processes data + builds
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

### Data Processing Commands
```bash
# Smart caching - only processes if CSV sources changed
npm run process-data

# Force reprocess demo data (bypass cache completely)
npm run process-data-force

# Trial quality analysis across T1-T30
npm run analyze-trials

# Astro CLI (for adding integrations, etc.)
npm run astro
```

### Smart Caching System
The data processing pipeline includes intelligent caching for 10-20x faster development:

**How It Works:**
- **Cache Check**: Compares timestamps of source CSV files vs generated JSON files
- **Smart Skip**: If JSON files are newer than CSV sources, skips processing entirely  
- **Auto-Process**: Only processes when source data has actually changed
- **Force Override**: Use `--force` flag to bypass cache when needed

**Performance:**
- **First run**: ~2-3 minutes (processes ~300MB of CSV data)
- **Subsequent runs**: ~500ms (cache hit)
- **Development startup**: 500ms vs 3 minutes

**Cache Validation:**
- âœ… Do T5-demo.json and T5-metadata.json exist?
- âœ… Are output files newer than all source CSV files?
- âœ… Are all source CSV files present?

## Architecture Overview

### Framework Structure
- **Astro**: Static site generator with component islands architecture
- **React Integration**: Interactive components hydrated on demand
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety across components and utilities
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling with custom brand configuration

### Page Structure
```
src/pages/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.astro           # Homepage with hero and features
â”œâ”€â”€ about/index.astro     # Professional profile with publications
â”œâ”€â”€ solutions/index.astro # Interactive gait analysis demo
â”œâ”€â”€ products/index.astro  # Product pipeline and development
â””â”€â”€ contact/index.astro   # Contact information and forms
```

### Component Organization
- **Layout Components**: Header, Footer, Layout (Astro components)
- **UI Components**: Button, SocialLinks (reusable Astro components)  
- **Interactive Components**: React components for demos and visualizations
- **Sections**: Page-specific content blocks

## Key Technologies

### Tailwind Configuration
Custom brand colors defined in `tailwind.config.mjs`:
- `black-pearl`: #040b1b (primary background)
- `burnt-sienna`: #eb5b48 (primary accent)
- `royal-purple`: #5c37a9 (secondary accent)
- `indigo`: #585ccc (tertiary accent)

### Interactive Demonstrations
The multi-sensor fusion demo uses Chart.js for real-time visualization, Zustand for state management, and features T5 trial data with constrained gait patterns.

**Current Status**: Phase B1a âœ… COMPLETED & DEPLOYED - Enhanced demo with mobile-first UX and comprehensive gait analysis
**Next Phase**: Phase B2 multi-algorithm comparison (Basic Fusion â†’ AI Fusion)

### State Management Structure
```typescript
// store.ts pattern for interactive components
interface MultiSensorFusionState {
  isPlaying: boolean;
  currentTime: number;
  enabledStages: {
    traditional: boolean;
    basicFusion: boolean;
    aiFusion: boolean;
  };
  algorithmResults: DetectionResult[];
  accuracyMetrics: AccuracyComparison;
}
```

## Brand Guidelines

### Typography
- **Primary Font**: Inter (Google Fonts)
- **Brand Text**: Orbitron font for "NORTHLAKE LABS" branding
- **Gradient Text**: Brand color gradients for headings

### Visual Patterns
- **Glass Morphism**: `bg-white/5 backdrop-blur-sm border border-white/10`
- **Hover Effects**: `hover:shadow-lg hover:shadow-royal-purple/20 transition-all duration-300 hover:-translate-y-2`
- **Gradient Backgrounds**: Three-color gradients using brand colors

## Deployment

### GitHub Pages Workflow
- Automated deployment via `.github/workflows/`
- Custom domain configuration for northlakelabs.com
- Static build output in `dist/` directory

### Build Configuration
```javascript
// astro.config.mjs
export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [tailwind(), react()],
  output: 'static',
  site: 'https://www.northlakelabs.com',
  trailingSlash: 'ignore'
});
```

## Development Notes

### Performance Considerations
- Astro's partial hydration for optimal loading
- Three.js components lazy-loaded for heavy 3D content
- Component islands pattern minimizes JavaScript bundle

### Mobile Optimization

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Follow existing component patterns when creating new components
- Use TypeScript for all new components and utilities
- Maintain consistent naming conventions (PascalCase for components, camelCase for functions)
- Preserve existing indentation and formatting patterns

### Interactive Components
- Use Astro components for static content, React for interactive features
- Follow the established pattern: separate hooks, types, and store files
- Real-time demos should target 60fps performance
- Include loading states and error boundaries for complex components

### Content Updates
- Professional content (publications, patents) should be factual and verifiable
- Maintain consistent tone: professional but accessible
- Use existing gradient text patterns for headings
- Follow mobile-first responsive design principles

### Testing Interactive Demos
When modifying multi-sensor fusion demo or other interactive components:
- Test across different screen sizes and mobile devices
- Verify Chart.js rendering performance at 60fps
- Ensure real-time data streaming doesn't cause memory leaks
- Check that playback controls are accessible via keyboard
- Validate algorithm accuracy progression is clearly visible
- Test CSV data processing pipeline with different trials

## Common Tasks

### Processing Demo Data
Demo data processing pipeline uses T5 trial as the selected dataset:
- **Run processing**: `npm run process-data` (generates T5-demo.json)
- **Analyze trials**: `npm run analyze-trials` (quality assessment of T1-T30)
- **Generated files**: `public/demo-data/T5-demo.json` (16.7MB) and `T5-metadata.json`

### Current Development Phase
**Phase B1**: âœ… COMPLETED & DEPLOYED - Traditional detection demo operational
**Phase B1a**: âœ… COMPLETED & DEPLOYED - Enhanced UX with mobile-first design and comprehensive gait analysis
**Phase B1b**: âœ… COMPLETED - Code quality improvements with accurate terminology (threshold_deviation)
**Phase B2**: ðŸŽ¯ NEXT - Multi-algorithm comparison (Basic Fusion â†’ AI Fusion)

### Adding New Publications
Publications are in `src/pages/about/index.astro` - follow existing format with title, journal, year, and DOI links.

### Modifying Demo Parameters  
Demo constants are defined in `types.ts` files within component directories. Key parameters:
- **Algorithm thresholds**: Force plate detection limits (20-1000N), EMG activation levels
- **Accuracy targets**: Traditional (60%), Basic Fusion (75%), AI Fusion (92%)
- **Terminology**: Updated "confidence" to "threshold_deviation" for technical accuracy
- **Processing settings**: Sampling rates, filter parameters, constraint detection
- **Data format**: JSON structure for 20-second constrained gait trials (T5 optimized)
- **Responsive display**: Chart window sizing (6s/4s/3s), panel collapsibility, mobile optimization
- **Gait analysis**: Temporal parameters, frequency metrics, asymmetry analysis, clinical interpretation

### Updating Brand Colors
Brand colors are centralized in `tailwind.config.mjs`. Use existing color variables rather than hex codes in components.
